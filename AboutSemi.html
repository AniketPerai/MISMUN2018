      <p>Set in 1969, the Semi Crisis Committee at MISMUN 2018 is a simulation of Richard Nixon’s White house situation room.</p>
      <p>The aftermath of World war II was characterized by an era of Hegemonic domination of two states: The United States and Soviet Union. The northern hemisphere was essentially further divided into two halves, the West and the East. As the United States began democracy-building missions across the world, it increasingly found itself competing with the Soviet Union’s efforts to expand communism throughout Europe and Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>The Vietnam War may have begun as a result of tensions between the communist Viet Minh and what used to be French colonial Vietnam, but was quickly absorbed into the larger Cold War, effectively becoming a proxy war between the United States and the Sino-Soviet alliance. When the United States committed itself militarily to the conflict, it spared little expense or resource.</p>
      <p>To understand the vested interests of the United States, one must first look at the result of The Geneva Convention. Herein, The key negotiators in attendance included France, the People’s Republic of China, the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. As the talks progressed, China and the Soviet Union were open to France’s suggestion of dividing the Vietnam temporarily, with the DRV governing the Northern side and Bao Dai’s government governing the Southern side. However, The United States could soon make its presence felt by installing Ngo Dinh Diem in the Southern side. Afraid of the Domino effect, the United States ensured that communism could not infect more nations than it already had.</p>
      <p>As we skip forward a few beats, we find ourselves in the current situation. As communists rally while capitalism takes a backseat and the condition gets worse day by day, there must be a solution nearby. It is now up to Richard Nixon and his ministers to fight the war both, on the domestic as well as international front.  </p>
