      <p>The media as we all know, shapes opinions and provides information. Yet, the work of a journalist in the Global Context extends to bounds way beyond solely providing information. And of course, it is often said: the less you know, the more you believe.</p>
      <p>The International Press at MISMUN 2018 consists of two elements: journalism and photojournalism. Their jobs however are the same; to hold delegates, ministers and world leaders accountable.</p>
      <p>Journalists will be required to write articles of different types revolving around the simulation, that is, the MUN. As the three committees proceed parallelly, journalists would note down each word, statistic and phrase ever so uttered by the participants and relay it to the public. For the public, the words of the journalist become a holy grail.</p>
      <p>As a journalist, your words will shape the way every action in this conference is perceived by the public. Your most important weapon against injustice is language, which is why you have to be constantly aware and lucid of what you write in all of your articles. Move on, make your pen your sword.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Hovering over the chaos in the committees, the responsibility of capturing the essence of the deliberation falls unto the photographers. Every act of dissent, of initiative, of assurance must not escape the watchful eyes of the photographers, who must slip around unnoticeably to encapsulate in their work, the life of debate.</p>
