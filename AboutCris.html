    </div>
      <p>Set in the year 1971, the Continuous Crisis Committee at MISMUN 2018 is a simulation of the Indian Armed Forces Cabinet. Against the backdrop of international chaos on both sides of the country, the Indian Armed Forces Cabinet must meet to formulate decisions regarding the Indo-Pak War that is to be waged.</p>
      <p>The pre-existing Indo-Pakistani conflict was further aggravated by the armed liberation struggle in East-Pakistan between the dominant Bengalis and the multi-ethnic West Pakistanis over the right to govern as well as the right to the Constitution. </p>
      <p>The general elections that had taken place in Pakistan in 1970 saw a fierce competition between two socialist parties: Pakistan People’s Party and The Awami League, and even though the Awami League won a landslide victory, assembly sessions were not held due to unwillingness from the side of the People’s Party. With growing distance between the West and the East sides of Pakistan, the previous political tensions, which were the very basis of the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, were enhanced.</p>
      <p>Murmurs of armed conflict with West Pakistanis have been observed for months now. Propaganda, possibly orchestrated by elements in the Government of West Pakistan, has now spread with slogans of ‘Crush India’ being slapped across vehicles.</p>
      <p>Now, India must act.</p>
