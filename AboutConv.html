      <p>A present day committee, the conventional committee at MISMUN 2018 is a simulation of the UN SOCHUM (United Nations Social, Cultural and Humanitarian Committee). This committee focuses on Feminism in Third World countries and women’s political representation.</p>
      <p>Feminism is the belief that advocates for the social, economic, and political equality of the sexes. The history of feminism, can be traced through the feminist movement, which refers to a series of political campaigns for reforms on issues such as reproductive rights, domestic violence, maternity leave, equal pay, women's suffrage, sexual harassment, and sexual violence, all of which fall under the label of feminism and the feminist movement.</p>
      <p>The feminist movement at this point however, has its share of challenges and barriers all varying from country to country. While in Saudi Arabia, women still fight to be able to apply to government jobs, countries like the United States and major European countries fight for equal pay for equal work. Hence, it is needless to say that the interpretation and execution of the feminist movement varies across the globe.</p>
      <p>Women in countries like India and Indonesia, face stratification, that is structured inequality in terms of access to resources, owing to the social landscape, which is backed and supported by cultural (and at times legal) and religious sanctions. Most of these countries have extremely traditional societies, which haven’t yet been changed to adapt modern welfare societies owing to a lack of development and education in these areas.</p>
      <p>This in turn, affects the role women play or the representation that women get in the political arena. Taking the example of India, a bill for the reservation of seats for women in the Lok Sabha has been pending for decades on end. </p>
      <p>It is now the job of the delegates of the SOCHUM to deliberate, discuss and debate over these pressing issues. It is up to them to transform this term and change perceptions. </p>
